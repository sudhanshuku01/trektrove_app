      <Text style={styles.title}>Koteshwar Mahadev Temple â€“ Rudraprayag</Text>

      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Koteshwar Mahadev Temple is located on the bank of the Alaknanda River in the Rudraprayag District of Uttarakhand, India. Situated about 3 km from the Main Market in the Garhwal Region, the temple is primarily dedicated to Lord Shiva. The unique feature of the temple being inside a cave near the holy river Alaknanda provides a panoramic scenic view of nature, attracting the attention of many tourists and devotees. The cave houses over 1000 naturally occurring ancient Shivalingas, with approximately 10-15 Shivalingas visible while coming down to the temple. The cave is approximately 150 m from the road head where visitors can easily purchase "Pooja ka Saman" (worship items).

      <Text style={styles.heading}>History of Koteshwar Mahadev Temple</Text>

      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Koteshwar Mahadev Temple has a rich mythological background with two connected legends. According to one legend, Lord Shiva meditated here on his way to Kedarnath. Another legend involves a demon named Bhasmasur, who, after receiving the power from Lord Shiva, attempted to destroy him. Lord Shiva sought refuge in the cave of Koteshwar (now known as Koteshwar Mahadev Temple) and meditated to seek help from Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu, in the avatar of "Mohini," saved Lord Shiva by attracting the demon towards her dance. The demon, excitedly touching his own head, turned into ashes. Devotees from distant places visit Koteshwar Dham Temple to seek blessings from Lord Shiva.
